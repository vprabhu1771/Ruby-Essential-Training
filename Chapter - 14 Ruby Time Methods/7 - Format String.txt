When using the strftime method in Ruby, you can use various format specifiers to represent different components of a time or date. Here's a list of commonly used format specifiers for constructing format strings:

%Y - Year with century (e.g., 2023)
%m - Month as a decimal number (01-12)
%d - Day of the month as a decimal number (01-31)
%H - Hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (00-23)
%M - Minute as a decimal number (00-59)
%S - Second as a decimal number (00-59)
%p - AM/PM indicator (AM or PM)
%b - Abbreviated month name (Jan, Feb, etc.)
%B - Full month name (January, February, etc.)
%a - Abbreviated weekday name (Sun, Mon, etc.)
%A - Full weekday name (Sunday, Monday, etc.)
%j - Day of the year as a decimal number (001-366)
%w - Weekday as a decimal number (0-6, Sunday is 0)
%Z - Time zone name

You can combine these format specifiers with other characters to create a desired format for your time or date string. For example, "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S" represents a format string that outputs the year, month, day, hour, minute, and second in a specific format.

Feel free to mix and match these format specifiers to construct the desired format for your time or date representation using the strftime method.
