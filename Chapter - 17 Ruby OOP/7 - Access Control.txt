Access Control: Understand the three levels of access control in Ruby: public, protected, and private, and how they affect method visibility.

class MyClass
  def public_method
    puts "This is a public method"
  end

  protected

  def protected_method
    puts "This is a protected method"
  end

  private

  def private_method
    puts "This is a private method"
  end
end

obj = MyClass.new
obj.public_method
# obj.protected_method # This would raise an error
# obj.private_method # This would raise an error
