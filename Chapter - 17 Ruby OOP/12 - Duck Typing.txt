Duck Typing: Understand the concept of duck typing, where the type or class of an object is determined by its behavior rather than explicit type declarations.

class Duck
  def speak
    puts "Quack!"
  end
end

class Dog
  def speak
    puts "Woof!"
  end
end

def make_sound(animal)
  animal.speak
end

duck = Duck.new
dog = Dog.new

make_sound(duck)
make_sound(dog)
