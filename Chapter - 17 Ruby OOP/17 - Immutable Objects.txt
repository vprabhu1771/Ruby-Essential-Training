Immutable Objects: Learn about creating immutable objects in Ruby using freezing and constant values.

class ImmutablePoint
  def initialize(x, y)
    @x = x.freeze
    @y = y.freeze
  end

  def coordinates
    "#{@x}, #{@y}"
  end
end

point = ImmutablePoint.new(3, 4)
puts point.coordinates

# Attempting to modify frozen values will raise an error:
# point.x = 5 # This would raise an error
