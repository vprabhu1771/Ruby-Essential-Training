Encapsulation: Learn how to encapsulate the internal state of objects by controlling access to their attributes through methods (getter and setter methods).

class BankAccount
  def initialize(balance)
    @balance = balance
  end

  def withdraw(amount)
    @balance -= amount if amount <= @balance
  end

  def balance
    @balance
  end
end

account = BankAccount.new(1000)
account.withdraw(500)
puts "Account balance: #{account.balance}"
