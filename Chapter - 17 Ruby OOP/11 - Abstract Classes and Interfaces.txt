Abstract Classes and Interfaces: Although Ruby doesn't have built-in support for abstract classes and interfaces, you can emulate them using conventions and modules.

module Shape
  def area
    raise NotImplementedError, "Subclasses must implement the area method"
  end
end

class Circle
  include Shape

  def initialize(radius)
    @radius = radius
  end

  def area
    Math::PI * @radius**2
  end
end

circle = Circle.new(5)
puts "Circle area: #{circle.area}"
