Sure! Here's an example of a Ruby script that uses the `dd` command to clone a drive:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

source_drive = "/dev/sda"    # Replace with the source drive path
target_drive = "/dev/sdb"    # Replace with the target drive path

block_size = "4M"            # Specify the block size for copying data

# Run the dd command to clone the drive
system("dd if=#{source_drive} of=#{target_drive} bs=#{block_size}")

puts "Drive cloning completed!"
```

Make sure to replace the `source_drive` and `target_drive` variables with the correct paths to your source and target drives, respectively.

Please note that drive cloning can be a potentially dangerous operation, and it's essential to double-check the drive paths to avoid accidentally overwriting important data.
